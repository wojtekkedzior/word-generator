# word-generator

Problem: Work out the number of possible combinations of letters in a given word.
Example: Using the British English dictionary on Ubuntu (/usr/share/dict/british-english) we end up with 159 words for an input word "planes"

## Details:

Given the word "planets", we have a total of 7 letters to work with. We need to find out the number of permutations we can make. Not only from all the 7 words, but also words of any length less then 7. 
To do this we use http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_counting-combperm.html (also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) which gives us something like:

    (7, 7)  ->  7*6*5*4*3*2*1 (in other words: 7!)
    (7, 6)  ->  7*6*5*4*3*2
    (7, 5)  ->  7*6*5*4*3
    (7, 4)  ->  7*6*5*4
    (7, 3)  ->  7*6*5
    (7, 2)  ->  7*6
    (7, 1)  ->  7

Rewritten to:

    7! + (7*6*5*4*3*2) + (7*6*5*4*3) + (7*6*5*4) + (7*6*5) + (7*6) + 7
    5040 + 5040 + 2520 + 840 + 210 + 42 +7 = 13699

Therefore, all the letters that make up the word "planets" can be arranged in 13699 different ways.  Note: my solution treats duplicate letters as unique, but this is broken because I'm using hashing to decrease lookup time. 

## Results

Times are from an Intel 4930K clocked at 4.30% Ghz

## Conclusion

This solution is great for combinations up 8 characters in length.  Anything more than that costs way too much in terms of Inefficiency when brute forcing the combinations.  Although using multiple go routines would probably speed things up even more, ultimately a much better solution is needed to figure out all the possible combinations.
