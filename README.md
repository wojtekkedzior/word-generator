# word-generator

Problem: Work out the number of possible letter combinations from letters in a given word.
Example: Using the British English dictionary on Ubuntu (/usr/share/dict/british-english) we can make 159 words with all the letters from the word "planets".

## Details:

Given the word "planets", we have a total of 7 letters to work with. We need to work out the number of unique combinations of letters we can make i.e permutations. To do this we use http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_counting-combperm.html (also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) which gives us something like:

    (7, 7)  ->  7*6*5*4*3*2*1 (in other words: 7!)
    (7, 6)  ->  7*6*5*4*3*2
    (7, 5)  ->  7*6*5*4*3
    (7, 4)  ->  7*6*5*4
    (7, 3)  ->  7*6*5
    (7, 2)  ->  7*6
    (7, 1)  ->  7

Rewritten to:

    7! + (7*6*5*4*3*2) + (7*6*5*4*3) + (7*6*5*4) + (7*6*5) + (7*6) + 7
    5040 + 5040 + 2520 + 840 + 210 + 42 +7 = 13699

Therefore, all the letters that make up the word "planets" can be arranged in 13699 different ways.  Note: my solution treats duplicate letters as unique which causes problem that I will fix sometimes in the future.

## Approach

### Brute force

Initially I figured that brute forcing all the permuatation could be done within a reasonable amount of time, however soon enough it dawned on me that as the sample size increases the brute force approach grows expenentially inefficent. This is becuase after some time it starts to generete already identified permutations making it less and less likely to find the missing ones. In other words the chances of genereting the very last permutation is about the same as the second permutation being exactly the same as the very first one.  This way the odds of finding the very last permutation decrease significantly as the word size increases. With small word sizes this is not a problem. 

### Recursion

This appraoch tries to minimize the number of iterations so that they match the number of permutations.  Each cycle should generete a new and unique permutation. It's more confusing to understand and debug, but it's significantly faster.  

## Results

The results are broken down by CPU and method.  I've selected a 9-character long word for the test.

## Conclusion

Bruteforce is easy to implement and works well up words 8-chars long. However anything over that length we see exponential slowdown.  Using recursion to figure out all the permutations is clearly the best way forward. 23 seconds vs 881 ms, it is a magnitude faster than the brute force solution. Intrisingly enough, this app needs more scaling when trying to deal with a 14-letter word. 

Note about the "Number of possibilites generated" being higher than the "Number of possibilities for length of xx ".  This happens because there are duplicated values.  Since traversing the entire tree takes in teh vanicity of 5.5ms, it's not worth trying to sort out the duplicates as the look-up-time saving would could in ns at best.  Instead, trying to figure out the duplicates when generating the permutations would likely make the generation slower.
